                -I have worked as a machinist for a company named Lieder Development,
                located in Ontario, California, for two summers. The work involved me taking schematics
                of wave guides(wires for microwaves) and using mills and CNC machines
                to make the design.<br /> -I have also been attending the University
                of San Diego since fall of 2022 to get my BS in computer science and plan to get my
                masters in cybersecurity.

                 -Played ice hockey for 13 years, still play to this day.<br />
                 -I'm currently working on a side project for winter break. It is a
                 radar equipped auto tracking fly shooter. Using an old arduino kit
                 from when I was a kid.<br />
                 -I've also been practicing the guitar a lot. I enjoy playing funk a lot, but classic
                 rock with high-pitched solos have been my focus recently.

              <h3>Chess Bot</h3>
              <p>
                Project Inspiration: <br />
                At first we wanted to make a blackjack card counting trainer, but due to our lack of
                the finer details of card counting, we decided to change projects. Why a chess bot?
                We wanted to do a project similar to our first idea and a chess bot came to mind when
                we saw one online and thought it would be a good project to replicate for experience.
              </p>
              <p>
              Functional requirements/what the project does: <br />
                All output and interaction is within the terminal. You will first select
                if you are playing against another person or the chess bot. If you choose
                a another person to play against, player1 will be white and player 2 will
                be black. You will be asked which piece you would like to move. To select
                you type the name of the piece then enter. We will then be presented with
                every valid move that piece can make. Each move has a number you select
                the move by typing in its number and pressing enter. This will continue until
                the game of chess comes to its natural conclusion. If at first you choose the
                chess bot, you will play it just as previously described, but only the opponent
                will move its own piece when it's their turn, instead of another player.
              </p>
              <p>
              Project design: <br />
                We have three major modules that are all called through a main class. The three major modules are the
                Game, Player  and Piece.<br /><br />
                Game: This contains 5 classes, the Game class, Board class, Position class, Move class and square class.
                The main purpose was to output a current instance of the board based on previous moves made by players.
                So whenever a move is made in a turn, a new board is created.<br /><br />
                Player: Player has a super-class known as player with two subclasses called HumanPlayer and AIPlayer.
                HumanPlayer allows for input from the user that can communicate with main and thus the other modules.
                AIPlayer class uses the minimax algorithm, a popular algorithm for chess bots, that makes decisions for
                player2 instead of a user input. <br /><br />
                Piece: Piece has a super-class known as piece, and every piece for a chessboard is a subclass. So we have
                pawn, rook, bishop, knight, queen and king.



              </p>
              <p>
              Implementation: <br />
                The board is made up of 64 squares. The squares are then maintained in a 2D array. Each square has
                a piece attribute, it can either be an instance of one of the Piece subclasses or be none. When the program
                is run the board is initialized with every piece in their starting square. The game always starts with
                it being player1's turn and player1 is always the white pieces. The user controlling player1 is asked
                what piece they'd like to move, which is associated with a piece on the board. Once the piece is selected,
                each piece has a method that calculates its valid moves. These valid moves are printed with numbers assigned
                to each move. The user types the number of the move they want to make. A move is its own class that has
                an execute and undo method. You can execute and undo a move as much as you'd like as a user. But a move
                must be executed before the turn is over and this is handled by main. A turn is terminated based on user
                input. Once a move is executed and a turn is complete, a new board instance is created with its 2D array
                of squares updated with the correctly moved piece and captured piece, if any. It then switches turns to
                player2. Now player2 can be another person, and if so the game would play just like how it does for player1,
                but instead you are moving the black pieces. If AIPlayer is selected at the start of the program, which
                is handled by the main class, the AIPlayer does a three depth search to find the most optimal move to make.
                But every class, as previously described, works exactly like it does for a human player, the move that is
                executed is just selected by an algorithm called the minimax algorithm. Three depth search means that the
                algorithm can make the most optimal decision three instances of the board ahead of the current instance.
                To relate that, it's like thinking three moves ahead. Every turn the state of the game is checked. If you
                are found to be in check, you are prompted with valid moves for the king only. If game is in check and the
                king has no valid moves to make, then checkmate, the game ends and the winning player is printed to terminal.
                There are additional rules such as stalemate and draw, but these are entirely based on conditions checked once
                every turn. Also, there is an enum class for the state of the game and a color enum class for pieces and squares.
